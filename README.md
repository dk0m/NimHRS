# NimHRS
Advanced Nim Based HTTPS Reverse Shell With Customization And Profile Support, Work In Progress.

## State Of The Project
I feel like this is one of only projects that I would love to work more on and actually finish because right now, The program is just really a simple webserver, Not an actual reverse shell (yet), Also I had one other project in nim that was never complete due to an issue (It was called AdbEmpire I believe), It was a very advanced ADB botnet, I will be uploading that project as well soon when I find it.
## Todo
- Make the client.
- Integrate the client with the project.
- Improve code structure.

## Features
- Customization With Profiles.
- Team Server Support (In The Future).
- Simple & Clean Terminal Interface.
